## A Gentle Introduction Into Deep Reinforcement Learning

### Introduction


### RL Algorithm Taxonomy
model-free vs model-based\
on-policy vs off-policy\

### RL Algorithm Tradeoffs
policy-iteration vs value-iteration
Sample efficiency — how many samples are needed to train a good policy?
Stability & convergence — how easy & how fast the model converges.
Generalization — Will the model generalize to other tasks?
Assumptions & approximation — Does the method have any other constraints? Does the method work on discrete or continuous action space? What approximate is used?
Exploration — How well does it explore the action space?
Policy-centric v.s. Model-centric.
Value-learning v.s. Policy Gradient
